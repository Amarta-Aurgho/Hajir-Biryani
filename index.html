      <h1>The only place to come!</h1>
      <p class="papra">The Hazi'r Biryani was founded by Hazi Mohammad Nizamuddin, A rich merchant of Dhaka. His wife
        Raisa Begum
        could cook amazing biryani recipes. She loved to experiment with the new masalas, different ingredients etc.
        Appaluded by his entire family, Raisa begum suggested Haji to open a restaurant in Old Dhaka. Soon his
        restaurant became famous for the unique taste and hygiene. Now we are one of the biggest restaurant in South
        Asia and has 57 branches all over the world. </p>

        <p>Murgi pulao of Haji'r Biriyani is phenomenal. They have fed me the pulao with their bare hand beause I don't
          have hands. I didnt kill them. However, 10/10.</p>
